        <h1>Engineering</h1>
        <p>
          When it comes to building JavaScript applications, I&apos;ve got the
          tools that make the magic happen. But hey, I&apos;m not dependent on
          themâ€”I can roll up my sleeves and deliver blazing-fast solutions that
          can handle anything, no matter the scale.{" "}
        </p>
        <p>
          Performance and scalability? Yeah, those are definitely high on my
          list of priorities. I&apos;ll make sure your app runs like a
          well-oiled machine, ticking all the boxes for speed and resilience

        <h1>Design</h1>
        <p>
          I&apos;m definitely not your average designer, hunched over an
          Illustrator artboard, obsessing over every pixel. Nah, that&apos;s not
          my style. You&apos;ll find me deep in the realm of stylesheets,
          tinkering with font sizes and playing around with layouts.
        </p>
        <p>
          My mission is to create user experiences that feel like a breeze,
          while also looking super fly. I&apos;m all about making things smooth
          and trendy, so you can bet I&apos;ll bring some serious style to the
          table.
